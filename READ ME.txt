Hey! This is the official welcome to the build thing. 

///I WILL GO THROUGH ALL OF THIS WITH YOU, ITS PROBABLY A BAD IDEA TO MESS WITH THIS THING TO MUCH///

First things first, you will need to open this game in visual studio. 

You can do this by going into the proj.win32 folder and clicking on the GCFramework.sln file. 

This *should* open the project in visual studio 2017. 

When you are looking at the solution, you need to build it. I will probably do this for you. but its not to hard. You just right click on the thing that says solution 'GCFramework' and click build. 

once its fully built, you can actually run the game by clicking on the Local Windows Debugger buttton with the big triangle on it.
